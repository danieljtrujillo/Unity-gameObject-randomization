# Unity-gameObject-randomization
 **A Unity C# script that randomizes game objects in an array**
 
 _ Add the script to a parent gameObject that contains an array of other gameObjects within its hierarchy
 
 _ Drag and drop all object you want to be randomized into the array field of the script in the inspector
 
 _ Create a button

 _ Create an onClick action in the inspector
 
 _ Drag the object containing the Randomizer.cs script into the onClick field
 
 _ Set the onClick action to Click() 
 
 _ Press play
 
 _ Watch your objects Randomize!
 
 **Additional Info**
 
 _ You can add it to individual buttons that randomize single attributes of a larger game object, or create 1 button that randomizes multiple attributes in a larger array of multiple objects
 
 _ Plan to create an Auto-recoginition of the objects within an array to cut back the amount of time spent on dragging and dropping large numbers of objects within an array
